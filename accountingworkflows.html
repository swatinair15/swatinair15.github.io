        <div class="break-line"></div>

        <h4>Prototype Development</h4>

        <p1>A digital prototype was developed to address the challenges identified in the survey. The prototype also integrates AI to assist with data entry and task automation while maintaining user-friendliness.</p1>

        <div class="break-line"></div>

        <h4>User Testing and Feedback</h4>

        <p1>Three participants from the original pool were selected to test the prototype in realistic task scenarios. Feedback was gathered using the think-aloud method and task completion time was measured.</p1>

        <div class="user-testing">

        <h4>Challenges and Learnings</h4>

        <p1>
            One of the key challenges in the project was the small sample size , which made it hard to capture the full range of experiences across the accounting industry. Another issue was integration with existing systems—many professionals still rely on legacy software, making it difficult to adopt AI-driven tools smoothly. Some users also found AI features a bit intimidating at first, emphasizing the need for clear explanations and better onboarding.
            <br><br>
            My biggest takeaways from this project is to keep it simple, and <span class="highlight">design AI to support–not replace–professionals</span>.
